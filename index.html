      <h2>Why I Care?</h2>
      <p>
        The inspiration to investigate the extent to which social media and the internet have taken from our human
        experience began after reflecting on the aspects of my life and the challenges I face. As a young adult in
        today’s modern society, I have experienced the ubiquity of technology and its effects (both good and bad)
        throughout my entire life. The constant presence of technology in my life has led to a negative and pervasive
        consequence: dependence. I feel a constant need to check my phone for new notifications or to read the latest
        interesting story that was just published. So much of my free time has been consumed by social media and the
        internet, with countless hours wasted scrolling through posts that I will forget within minutes. While this
        dependence can be explained as a lack of control or discipline, this explanation, though partly true, requires
        further exploration, especially when so many young adults face the same obstacle. We must gain a deeper
        understanding of how much these devices, which were meant to supplement our lives, have instead taken it away.

      <h2>The Fragmented Mind: How Social Media Erodes Attention and Well-Being
      </h2>
      <p>“Everyone knows what attention is. It's the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form of one out of what seems several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought.” <br>- William James (Father of Psychology)</p>

          Social media encourages rapid, fragmented interactions, constantly feeding you entertainment through easily accessible content. This aspect of social media has significantly altered the way we consume information, contributing to a dramatic reduction in our attention span. Most people in modern society cannot remember a day without digital distractions, and those who can end up succumbing and returning to a world filled with constant interruptions. As a society, we have cultivated a reality in which we are tethered to our computers and phones, both loaded with distractions. These distractions are negatively affecting our ability to focus and concentrate on tasks for extended periods. The decline in our ability to concentrate for long durations has been well-documented and researched, and the results are truly concerning.        </p>

          Dr. Gloria Mark, a psychologist and the Chancellor's Professor of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, studies how individuals engage with technology in their daily lives and its impact on attention, multitasking, mood, and stress. Her perspective is crucial when discussing the decrease in our attention capacity.
        </p>
        <p class="study">
          Dr. Mark has been researching our ability to focus since 2004 and has found that our attention span has decreased by nearly 70%. She conducted a study where she would "shadow people with stopwatches for every single activity they did" and "record the start time and the stop time." Her findings were surprising but not unexpected in a society driven by the internet: "...we found the average attention span on any screen to be two and a half minutes on average. Over the years, it became shorter. Around 2012, we found it to be 75 seconds." This evident decline in our ability to focus has real-world and tangible consequences, affecting not just our productivity but also our overall health.

          Dr. Mark’s research goes beyond her stopwatch experiment; she has also analyzed and found that the act of multitasking and frequently switching tasks results in an increase in blood pressure and stress. "We find in our research a correlation between the frequency of attention switching and stress... We know from decades of research in the laboratory that when people multitask, they experience stress, and blood pressure rises." These problems are not fictitious or some fabrication from an older generation that wants the newer generations to be more unplugged and in the moment. These problems have real-world implications for those affected by the constant distractions our smart devices cause.
        </p>
        <p class="study">
          We must start and continue to be aware of how we use these devices to ensure we are always in control. In a world dominated by digital distractions, which has caused an alarming decrease in our attention span, as illustrated by Dr. Mark’s research, we should use this as a wake-up call to reflect and revise how we engage with technology. The way we consume it has reshaped not only our productivity but also our mental and physical well-being.

      <h2>The Unsettling Duality of Social Media: Connection or Isolation?

        <p>The dual nature of social media necessitates constant vigilance due to its mix of advantages and challenges. While these platforms enhance communication and provide valuable information, there's a significant risk of becoming overly dependent on digital interactions, potentially leading to negative lifestyle habits. Additionally, the rapid integration of social media into daily life is both impressive and concerning. Since the early 2000s, the percentage of U.S. adults using social media has surged dramatically, from a mere five percent to approximately seventy percent, largely due to the proliferation of various platforms that weren't available two decades ago.</p>

        <img src="./Images/manydevices.jpg" alt="placeholder">
        <p>Jeffrey Hall, Ph.D. and director of the Relationships and Technology Lab at the University of Kansas, highlights a significant social concern: social media may be diminishing our social skills, affecting both young people and adults. In his study, Hall had participants log their daily activities, comparing periods of social media use with periods of abstention. Surprisingly, he discovered that abstaining from social media did not lead to increased face-to-face interactions with close social ties. This suggests that the various communication methods available—such as texting, emailing, calling, and meeting in person—serve different roles, and eliminating one doesn't necessarily enhance the others. This underscores the importance of maintaining genuine relationships and mindful use of social media to capitalize on its benefits without letting it erode the quality of our personal interactions.

        <p>Social media has undeniably reshaped how we communicate and connect with others, this is why it is imperative that we balance this new from of communication by always being intentional. The exponential growth of social media platforms has redefined how with socially interact but we should not replace this new form of connection to replace meaningful face to face connections. We have been forced to navigate a world changed by the digital age which is why it is critical that we recognize the importance of maintaining genuine relationsiips and reduce or attachments on virtual communication. These tools should be meet with mindfulness in order for use to capitilize on the benefits of social media without allowing it to erode the quality and quantity of our personal interactions and social acumen.
