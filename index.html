      <p>
        The inspiration to investigate the extent to which social media and the internet have taken from our human
        experience began after reflecting on the aspects of my life and the challenges I face. As a young adult in
        today’s modern society, I have experienced the ubiquity of technology and its effects (both good and bad)
        throughout my entire life. The constant presence of technology in my life has led to a negative and pervasive
        consequence: dependence. I feel a constant need to check my phone for new notifications or to read the latest
        interesting story that was just published. So much of my free time has been consumed by social media and the
        internet, with countless hours wasted scrolling through posts that I will forget within minutes. While this
        dependence can be explained as a lack of control or discipline, this explanation, though partly true, requires
        further exploration, especially when so many young adults face the same obstacle. We must gain a deeper
        understanding of how much these devices, which were meant to supplement our lives, have instead taken it away.

In order to truly understand and quantify the pervasive nature of social media and the internet we need to understand how much things have changed In such a small duration of time. Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan think tank that conducts data lead research on various topics, including social trends in order to inform the public. They conducted a report that illustrated the surge in Americans and general adults present on the internet. The graphs illustrate a dramatic rise in social media across a pivotal decade when it comes to discussing the modern technological boom. From 2005 to 2015, social media adoption soared across all demographics with overall adults usage growing exponentially from 10% in 2005 to 65% in 2015. This trend is only emphasize when looking at young adults aged 18-29, the usage reached an eye watering 90%. This alarming growth transcends traditional barriers, with both men and women using social media at essentially the same rate additionally across racial and ethic groups there are minamal differences. The greatest divide when it comes to those with an internet presence is dictated by education level. Illustrated in the charts we see that those with a high school education or less fall short of those who are college graduates. Thought these trends and graphs we can see how there has been a profound shift in how we engage and interact with the world, we are spending more of our time and presence online, which has inadverlyy reshaped how we communicate, socially interact, and access information.

          Social media encourages rapid, fragmented interactions, constantly feeding you entertainment through easily accessible content. This aspect of social media has significantly altered the way we consume information, contributing to a dramatic reduction in our attention span. Most people in modern society cannot remember a day without digital distractions, and those who can end up succumbing and returning to a world filled with constant interruptions. As a society, we have cultivated a reality in which we are tethered to our computers and phones, both loaded with distractions. These distractions are negatively affecting our ability to focus and concentrate on tasks for extended periods. The decline in our ability to concentrate for long durations has been well-documented and researched, and the results are truly concerning.        </p>

          Dr. Gloria Mark, a psychologist and the Chancellor's Professor of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, studies how individuals engage with technology in their daily lives and its impact on attention, multitasking, mood, and stress. Her perspective is crucial when discussing the decrease in our attention capacity.
        </p>
        <p class="study">
          Dr. Mark has been researching our ability to focus since 2004 and has found that our attention span has decreased by nearly 70%. She conducted a study where she would "shadow people with stopwatches for every single activity they did" and "record the start time and the stop time." Her findings were surprising but not unexpected in a society driven by the internet: "...we found the average attention span on any screen to be two and a half minutes on average. Over the years, it became shorter. Around 2012, we found it to be 75 seconds." This evident decline in our ability to focus has real-world and tangible consequences, affecting not just our productivity but also our overall health.

          Dr. Mark’s research goes beyond her stopwatch experiment; she has also analyzed and found that the act of multitasking and frequently switching tasks results in an increase in blood pressure and stress. "We find in our research a correlation between the frequency of attention switching and stress... We know from decades of research in the laboratory that when people multitask, they experience stress, and blood pressure rises." These problems are not fictitious or some fabrication from an older generation that wants the newer generations to be more unplugged and in the moment. These problems have real-world implications for those affected by the constant distractions our smart devices cause.
        </p>
        <p class="study">
          We must start and continue to be aware of how we use these devices to ensure we are always in control. In a world dominated by digital distractions, which has caused an alarming decrease in our attention span, as illustrated by Dr. Mark’s research, we should use this as a wake-up call to reflect and revise how we engage with technology. The way we consume it has reshaped not only our productivity but also our mental and physical well-being.

        <p>The dual nature of social media necessitates constant vigilance due to its mix of advantages and challenges. While these platforms enhance communication and provide valuable information, there's a significant risk of becoming overly dependent on digital interactions, potentially leading to negative lifestyle habits. Additionally, the rapid integration of social media into daily life is both impressive and concerning. Since the early 2000s, the percentage of U.S. adults using social media has surged dramatically, from a mere five percent to approximately seventy percent, largely due to the proliferation of various platforms that weren't available two decades ago.</p>

        <img src="./Images/manydevices.jpg" alt="placeholder">
        <p>Jeffrey Hall, Ph.D. and director of the Relationships and Technology Lab at the University of Kansas, highlights a significant social concern: social media may be diminishing our social skills, affecting both young people and adults. In his study, Hall had participants log their daily activities, comparing periods of social media use with periods of abstention. Surprisingly, he discovered that abstaining from social media did not lead to increased face-to-face interactions with close social ties. This suggests that the various communication methods available—such as texting, emailing, calling, and meeting in person—serve different roles, and eliminating one doesn't necessarily enhance the others. This underscores the importance of maintaining genuine relationships and mindful use of social media to capitalize on its benefits without letting it erode the quality of our personal interactions.

        <p>Social media has undeniably reshaped how we communicate and connect with others, this is why it is imperative that we balance this new from of communication by always being intentional. The exponential growth of social media platforms has redefined how with socially interact but we should not replace this new form of connection to replace meaningful face to face connections. We have been forced to navigate a world changed by the digital age which is why it is critical that we recognize the importance of maintaining genuine relationsiips and reduce or attachments on virtual communication. These tools should be meet with mindfulness in order for use to capitilize on the benefits of social media without allowing it to erode the quality and quantity of our personal interactions and social acumen.

      <h2 class="fancy-header" >Is Freedom Possible ?</h2>
      <p>
        So, is that it? Are these the crosses we must bear in a world driven by technology? Absolutely not. However, the journey back to a life and a world that isn’t consumed by our devices and technology is far from trivial. To reclaim our lives from the clutches of technology, we must begin with conscious, deliberate actions. We need to set clear boundaries to cultivate genuine connections and reclaim our time. This is a battle that will not cease but will only grow more challenging.

We must heed the advice of Johann Hari, a Scottish writer and author of Stolen Focus, a book exploring technology’s impact on attention spans and mental health. Hari urges us to take a stand, stating, 'None of these changes will happen unless we fight for them. Just as the feminist movement reclaimed women’s right to their own bodies (and still has to fight for it today), I believe we now need an attention movement to reclaim our minds. I believe we need to act urgently because this may be like the climate crisis or the obesity crisis – the longer we wait, the harder it will get. The more our attention degrades, the harder it will be to summon the personal and political energy to take on the forces stealing our focus.'

This revolution to reclaim our lives will not be an easy fight, but the moment we decide to unplug, we create space for deeper connections and real experiences. Freedom from our devices begins with small moments of intentional disconnection. We must not allow these devices to dominate our lives; instead, we must take full control of how we use them, ensuring they serve us rather than enslave us. It is imperative that we reclaim our time, attention, and humanity in a world that demands us to be fully alive.
