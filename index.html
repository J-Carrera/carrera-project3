      <h2>Why I Care</h2>
      <p>The inspiration to investigate the extent to which social media and the internet have taken from our human
        experience began after reflecting on the aspects of my life and the challenges I face. As a young adult in
        todayâ€™s modern society, I have experienced the ubiquity of technology and its effects (both good and bad)
        throughout my entire life. The constant presence of technology in my life has led to a negative and pervasive
        consequence: dependence. I feel a constant need to check my phone for new notifications or to read the latest
        interesting story that was just published. So much of my free time has been consumed by social media and the
        internet, with countless hours wasted scrolling through posts that I will forget within minutes. While this
        dependence can be explained as a lack of control or discipline, this explanation, though partly true, requires
        further exploration, especially when so many young adults face similar obstacles. We must gain a deeper
        understanding of how these devices, which were meant to supplement our lives, have instead taken them away.</p>
